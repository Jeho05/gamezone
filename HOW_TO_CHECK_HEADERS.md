## You're Almost There! 

You're in the Network tab - GOOD! ✅

Now you need to see the **Response Headers** section.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Current View:
You're seeing:
```
GET https://ismo.gamer.gd/api/test.php
État: 200 OK
Version: HTTP/1.1
Transfert: 1,19 Ko
```

### What to Do Next:

**1. In the Network tab, you should see tabs like:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ En-têtes | Réponse | Cookies | ...     │  ← Click "En-têtes" (Headers)
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**2. Click on "En-têtes" (or "Headers")**

**3. Scroll down to find section:**
```
En-têtes de réponse (Response Headers)
```

**4. Look for these lines:**
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ...
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: ...
Content-Type: ...
```

---

## 📸 What You Should Copy:

**Copy ALL lines under "En-têtes de réponse" (Response Headers)**

Example of what to look for:
```
Content-Type: application/json
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://gamezoneismo.vercel.app
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Date: ...
Server: ...
```

---

## 🚨 OR Use This Simpler Method:

**Just open this URL in a new tab:**
```
https://ismo.gamer.gd/api/cors-check.php
```

**Copy the entire JSON response and send it to me!**

This file was created specifically to check if CORS is configured.

---

## 🎯 What I Need From You:

**Option 1 (Easiest):**
Open https://ismo.gamer.gd/api/cors-check.php
Copy the JSON response

**Option 2:**
In Network tab → test.php → En-têtes → En-têtes de réponse
Copy all the headers you see

Send me either one and I'll know exactly what to do next!

## 💡 Quick Tip:

If you see **NO "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"** in the headers,
it means files are NOT uploaded yet and you need to use FileZilla.

If you **DO see "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"**,
then files ARE uploaded and we just need to clear cache!
