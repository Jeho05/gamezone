# üîç Upload Status Verification Guide

The error shows:
```
Status: 200 OK (Server responding)
Issue: Access-Control-Allow-Origin header missing

```

---

## üß™ Step 1: Test if Files Are Uploaded

**Open these URLs in your browser:**

### Test 1: Basic Test Endpoint
```
https://ismo.gamer.gd/api/test.php
```

**Expected if FILES UPLOADED:**
```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "content_type": "NONE",
  "origin": "NONE",
  ...
}
```

**Check Network Tab (F12 ‚Üí Network ‚Üí test.php ‚Üí Headers):**
```
‚úÖ Access-Control-Allow-Origin: (should be present)
‚úÖ Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

**If headers are MISSING** ‚Üí Files not uploaded yet!

### Test 2: CORS Diagnostic
```
https://ismo.gamer.gd/api/cors-check.php
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "CORS Diagnostic",
  "config_exists": true,
  "headers_sent": [
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ...",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true"
  ]
}
```

**If `config_exists: false`** ‚Üí config.php not uploaded!

## üì§ Step 2: Upload Files via FileZilla

### Connection Details:
```
Host:     ftpupload.net
Port:     21
Username: if0_40238088
Password: OTnlRESWse7lVB
```

### Critical Files to Upload (in order):

**1. Upload Core Configuration:**
```
Local: C:\xampp\htdocs\projet ismo\backend_infinityfree\api\.htaccess
Remote: /htdocs/api/.htaccess
```

**2. Upload CORS Config:**
```
Local: C:\xampp\htdocs\projet ismo\backend_infinityfree\api\config.php
Remote: /htdocs/api/config.php
```

**3. Upload Utilities:**
```
Local: C:\xampp\htdocs\projet ismo\backend_infinityfree\api\utils.php
Remote: /htdocs/api/utils.php
```

**4. Upload Diagnostic Files:**
```
Local: C:\xampp\htdocs\projet ismo\backend_infinityfree\api\cors-check.php
Remote: /htdocs/api/cors-check.php
```

**5. Upload Security Middleware:**
```
Local: C:\xampp\htdocs\projet ismo\backend_infinityfree\api\middleware\security.php
Remote: /htdocs/api/middleware/security.php
```

**6. Upload Auth Files:**
```

## üéØ Step 3: Verify Upload Success

After uploading each file, **WAIT 10-30 SECONDS** (server cache), then:

### Test Again:
```
https://ismo.gamer.gd/api/cors-check.php
```

**Should now show:**
```json
{
  "status": "CORS Diagnostic",
  "config_exists": true,  ‚Üê Should be true!
  "headers_sent": [
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://gamezoneismo.vercel.app",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true"
  ]
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Test Login from Vercel

Once CORS headers appear:

1. **Clear browser cache:**
   ```
   Ctrl + Shift + Delete
   ‚Üí Clear cached images and files
   ```

2. **Hard refresh Vercel app:**
   ```
   Go to: https://gamezoneismo.vercel.app
   Press: Ctrl + Shift + R
   ```

3. **Try login** - should work!

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Can't connect to ftpupload.net"

### Issue: "Can't find /htdocs/ directory"

**Solutions:**
- After connecting, you should see folders automatically

- Clear browser cache completely
- Check file uploaded to correct location
